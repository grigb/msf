## For MSF Working Group

These are the prioritized recommendations for MSF AI x Metaverse Working Group action.

<ActionItem priority={1} effort="MEDIUM" timeline="Q2 2026">
**Propose MSF_ai_generation_metadata glTF extension**

No existing work addresses AI generation metadata. This is a greenfield opportunity with high impact on reproducibility and interoperability.

**Scope:**
- Generation prompt/parameters
- Seed and random state
- Model version and configuration
- Quality metrics
- Generation timestamp

**Path:** Vendor extension -> KHR ratification
</ActionItem>

<ActionItem priority={2} effort="MEDIUM" timeline="Q3 2026">
**Define geometry quality validation profiles**

Addresses topology errors that block production use. Enables certification of AI-generated content.

**Scope:**
- Non-manifold detection
- Physics compatibility checks
- UV quality assessment
- LOD requirements
- Polygon budget compliance
</ActionItem>

<ActionItem priority={3} effort="LOW" timeline="Q1 2026">
**Formally engage C2PA for 3D workflow support**

Critical gap in provenance tracking. MSF can advocate on behalf of the industry.

**Scope:**
- Establish MSF liaison with C2PA
- Document 3D workflow requirements
- Propose glTF/USD embedding mechanisms
</ActionItem>

<ActionItem priority={4} effort="LOW" timeline="Ongoing">
**Support KHR_gaussian_splatting ratification**

Enable neural representation interchange. Monitor and contribute to Khronos work.

**Scope:**
- Track PR #2490 progress
- Contribute use cases from AI generation
- Support compression work (SPZ_2)
</ActionItem>

<ActionItem priority={5} effort="HIGH" timeline="Q4 2026">
**Convene world package format discussion**

Complex multi-SDO coordination needed. MSF is uniquely positioned to facilitate.

**Scope:**
- Bring together Khronos, AOUSD stakeholders
- Define requirements for portable world packaging
- Identify lead SDO and scope
</ActionItem>

## Research Priorities

These research questions should be addressed to inform standards work.

| Priority | Research Question | Method | Resources Needed |
|----------|------------------|--------|------------------|
| 1 | What metadata is essential for AI generation reproducibility? | Creator surveys, workflow analysis | 3-month study, industry partners |
| 2 | What topology quality thresholds are acceptable for physics? | Benchmark with game studios | Technical study, engine expertise |
| 3 | Can deterministic generation be achieved across GPU vendors? | Technical feasibility study | NVIDIA, AMD, Intel engagement |

### Research Question 1: Essential Metadata

**Why it matters:** Informs MSF_ai_generation_metadata schema design

**Approach:**
- Survey creators using AI generation tools
- Analyze existing metadata exports from tools
- Identify minimum viable metadata set
- Validate with reproducibility testing

### Research Question 2: Topology Quality Thresholds

**Why it matters:** Defines quality validation profiles

**Approach:**
- Partner with game studios
- Test AI-generated meshes in production engines
- Measure physics failure rates
- Define acceptable thresholds

### Research Question 3: Deterministic Generation

**Why it matters:** Enables multiplayer AI-generated content

**Approach:**
- Technical review of AI model architectures
- GPU vendor consultation
- Test reproducibility across hardware
- Document achievable determinism levels

## Use Case Development

These use cases should be prioritized for standards work.

| Use Case | Priority | Readiness | Dependencies |
|----------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Batch AI World Generation for Games** | HIGH | Ready | Quality validation profiles |
| **Runtime AI Environment Generation** | MEDIUM | Needs Research | Determinism specification |
| **AI Generation Metadata Interchange** | HIGH | Ready | Extension proposal |
| **Neural-to-Mesh Conversion Workflows** | HIGH | Blocked | KHR_gaussian_splatting ratification |


### Batch AI World Generation

**Status:** Ready for standards work
**Blocking:** Quality validation profiles

Use case: Game developers generate world assets via AI tools, then import into engines for production use.

### Runtime AI Generation

**Status:** Needs research
**Blocking:** Determinism specification

Use case: Games generate content at runtime using AI, requiring reproducibility for multiplayer synchronization.

### AI Metadata Interchange

**Status:** Ready for standards work
**Blocking:** Extension proposal

Use case: AI-generated assets carry metadata about generation parameters, enabling reproducibility and provenance.

### Neural-to-Mesh Conversion

**Status:** Blocked
**Blocking:** KHR_gaussian_splatting ratification

Use case: Content created in neural-native tools (Gaussian splats) converted to mesh for engine use.
