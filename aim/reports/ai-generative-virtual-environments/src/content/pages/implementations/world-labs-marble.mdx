## Maturity Assessment

**SRL Score:** SRL-5 (Early Adoption)

**Evidence:**
- $230M+ funding achieved unicorn status
- Production SaaS with paying customers across VFX, games, and enterprise
- First commercial "Large World Model" product

---

## Interoperability

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Export Formats** | GLB, PLY (Gaussian splats), native Marble format, video |
| **Import Formats** | Text, images, video |
| **API Availability** | Yes (commercial tiers) |
| **Known Integrations** | Rosebud AI (gameplay), VFX studios (undisclosed) |


---

## Strengths

1. **First commercial world model with exportable geometry** - Proves the feasibility of combining world model approaches with practical asset pipelines

2. **Spatial editing via Chisel** - Provides designer control through block-out editing before AI style generation

3. **Multi-platform output** - Outputs compatible with VR headsets (Vision Pro, Quest 3)


---

## Limitations

1. **No native navmesh generation** - Must be generated in-engine post-export

2. **Quality loss in conversion** - ~15% visual quality loss when converting splats to mesh

3. **Commercial licensing required** - $35-95/month for production use

## MSF Relevance

World Labs Marble is the **first production system demonstrating that world models can produce engine-compatible output**. This proves the feasibility of standards for:

- AI generation metadata
- Quality validation profiles
- Neural-to-mesh conversion specifications

Marble represents the target use case for MSF_ai_generation_metadata extension work.
