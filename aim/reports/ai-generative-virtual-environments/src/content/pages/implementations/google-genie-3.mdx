## Basic Information

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Organization** | Google DeepMind |
| **Type** | Research (not commercially available) |
| **Launch Date** | August 2025 |
| **Current Version** | Genie 3 |
| **URL** | [deepmind.google/discover/blog/](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/) |
| **Availability** | Research only |

<SRLBadge level={4} label="SRL-4: Pilot" />

## Capability Profile

| Capability | Support | Notes |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Single Image to World | **Full** | Primary input |
| Real-time Interactivity | **Full** | &lt;100ms latency |
| Promptable World Events | **Full** | Text commands mid-session |
| 3D Export | **None** | Video stream only |
| Action Space | Partial | Navigation only; no object manipulation |
| Session Length | Partial | 3-5 minute persistence |


---

## Standards Compliance

| Standard | Compliance | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| **glTF 2.0** | None | No 3D export |
| **OpenUSD** | None | No 3D export |
| **Any 3D format** | None | Outputs video frames only |

**Key Insight:** Genie 3 represents the video-based paradigm that **cannot be addressed by traditional 3D standards**. Its output is interactive pixel streams, not geometry.

---

## Maturity Assessment

**SRL Score:** SRL-4 (Pilot)

**Evidence:**
- Research demonstration with published papers
- Not commercially available
- Designed for AI agent training (SIMA), not consumer products

---

## Interoperability

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Export Formats** | Interactive video stream only |
| **Import Formats** | Single image, text prompts |
| **API Availability** | No (research only) |
| **Known Integrations** | DeepMind SIMA agent |

## Strengths

1. **Real-time interactivity with emergent physics** - Worlds respond to user actions with plausible physics simulation

2. **Infinite variation** - Memory footprint independent of world size; can generate arbitrarily large environments

3. **Promptable mid-session events** - Dynamic world modification through text commands during play


---

## Limitations

1. **No exportable 3D geometry** - Outputs locked to video stream; cannot be used in game engines

2. **Navigation-only action space** - No picking, crafting, throwing, or object manipulation

3. **Non-persistent worlds** - Worlds are reimagined each session; no save/load

4. **Short memory horizon** - ~1 minute before "forgetting" off-screen elements

---

## Architecture Diagram


The system uses **next-token prediction** to generate video frames:

1. Input image processed by vision encoder
2. Current state encoded as tokens
3. Next frame predicted based on action input
4. Frame rendered and displayed
5. Loop continues in real-time

---

## MSF Relevance

Genie 3 represents the **video-based paradigm that cannot be addressed by traditional 3D standards**.

**Implications for MSF:**
- Any MSF work must acknowledge this paradigm exists
- Focus interoperability efforts on geometry-based systems
- Monitor video-to-3D reconstruction research as potential bridge
- Do not attempt to standardize video-based outputs directly

---

## Research Value

While not directly standardizable, Genie 3's architecture informs understanding of:

- Real-time world generation requirements
- Agent training environment needs
- The fundamental tradeoff between interactivity and exportability
