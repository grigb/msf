## Implementation Landscape Gaps

These gaps affect multiple implementations and represent opportunities for standards work:

| Gap | Impact | Implementations Affected | Potential Solutions |
|-----|--------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| No cross-system generation metadata | **HIGH** | All systems | MSF-proposed glTF extension |
| Video-based outputs non-exportable | **HIGH** | Genie 3, Oasis, Odyssey | Video-to-3D reconstruction research |
| Gaussian splat format fragmentation | **HIGH** | Marble, Luma, neural tools | KHR_gaussian_splatting ratification |
| Navmesh not generated (most systems) | MEDIUM | Marble, Meshy, most tools | In-engine generation required |
| Physics mesh topology errors | **HIGH** | All geometry generators | Validation profiles + repair tools |
| Platform lock-in (UGC platforms) | **HIGH** | Roblox, Meta Horizon | Interoperability standards pressure |
| No determinism specification | MEDIUM | All systems | MSF multiplayer determinism work |
