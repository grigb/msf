## Maturity Assessment

**SRL Score:** SRL-6 (Growth)

**Evidence:**
- **3M+ users**
- **30M+ assets generated**
- Production use in game development, e-commerce, and enterprise
- Free tier enables broad adoption with paid tiers ($14-150/mo) for commercial use

---

## Interoperability

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Export Formats** | glTF/GLB, FBX, OBJ, USDZ |
| **Import Formats** | Text, images |
| **API Availability** | Yes (REST API) |
| **Known Integrations** | Unity, Unreal, Blender, Godot |


---

## Strengths

1. **Best-in-class engine integrations** - Native plugins for all major game engines (Unity, Unreal, Blender, Godot)

2. **Production-ready output quality** - Suitable for prototyping and many production use cases

3. **Accessible pricing** - Go-to tool for indie developers with generous free tier


---

## Limitations

1. **Single-object focus** - Not environment/scene generation; asset-level only

2. **Topology cleanup required** - Outputs need refinement for game-ready topology

3. **No physics or navmesh** - Pure geometry output; game infrastructure generated separately

## MSF Relevance

Meshy is the **most widely adopted standalone AI 3D generation tool**. Its significance for MSF:

1. **Model for standards compliance** - Strong glTF adoption shows how AI tools can integrate with existing standards

2. **Reference for quality validation** - Demonstrates production-ready output quality achievable today

3. **Asset-level baseline** - While not world-level generation, establishes expectations for single-object quality

4. **Interoperability success story** - Broad engine plugin support shows what's possible
