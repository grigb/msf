## Basic Information

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Organization** | Roblox Corporation |
| **Type** | Open Source + Commercial Platform |
| **Launch Date** | GDC March 2025 (open-sourced) |
| **Current Version** | Cube 3D 1.8B parameters |
| **URL** | [github.com/roblox/cube](https://github.com/roblox/cube) |
| **License** | MIT (model), Proprietary (platform) |

<SRLBadge level={5} label="SRL-5: Early Adoption" />

---

## Capability Profile

| Capability | Support | Notes |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Text-to-Mesh | **Full** | Shape-as-token architecture |
| In-Experience Generation | **Full** | Lua API for runtime generation |
| Scene Building Commands | **Full** | "Add streetlights along this road" |
| AI Assistant | **Full** | Production since 2023 |
| 4D Generation Roadmap | Planned | Context-aware with behaviors |


---

## Standards Compliance

| Standard | Compliance | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| **glTF 2.0** | None | Roblox-native formats |
| **Open Source Model** | **Full** | MIT license on Cube model |
| **Proprietary Platform** | Full | Roblox Studio integration |

**Unique Position:** Open-source model, closed platform ecosystem.

---

## Maturity Assessment

**SRL Score:** SRL-5 (Early Adoption)

**Evidence:**
- Open-sourced production model (1.8B parameters)
- Trained on **1.5M 3D assets** - largest announced dataset
- 535 million characters of AI-suggested code adopted by June 2024
- Material Generator has 100%+ adoption increase

---

## Interoperability

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Export Formats** | Roblox-native only |
| **Import Formats** | Text prompts, reference images |
| **API Availability** | Yes (Lua API for in-experience generation) |
| **Known Integrations** | Roblox Studio, Roblox runtime |

---

## Strengths

1. **Open-source model** - MIT license enables research and adaptation outside Roblox

2. **Largest training dataset** - 1.5M 3D assets, more than any other announced system

3. **Runtime generation API** - Enables dynamic content generation during gameplay

4. **"4D" roadmap** - Addresses behavioral generation (3D + interaction)


---

## Limitations

1. **Platform-locked outputs** - Generated content works only in Roblox ecosystem

2. **Aesthetic optimization** - Output quality optimized for Roblox's stylized aesthetic, not photorealism

3. **Scene-level generation still roadmap** - "Road to 4D AI" announced but not shipped

---

## Technical Architecture


### Shape-as-Token Innovation

Cube 3D uses a novel "shape-as-token" architecture:

1. 3D shapes tokenized into discrete vocabulary
2. Text and shape tokens unified in single transformer
3. Generation produces shape tokens directly
4. Tokens decoded to Roblox-native meshes

### Model Specifications

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Parameters | 1.8B |
| Training Data | 1.5M 3D assets |
| Architecture | Transformer (shape-as-token) |
| License | MIT |

---

## "Road to 4D AI"

Roblox's announced roadmap includes **4D generation** - 3D with interaction behaviors:


| Phase | Capability | Status |
|-------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Text-to-3D mesh | **Shipped** |
| 2 | Scene building commands | **Shipped** |
| 3 | Runtime generation API | **Shipped** |
| 4 | Context-aware behaviors | Roadmap |
| 5 | Full 4D generation | Roadmap |

---

## Adoption Metrics

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| AI-suggested code adopted | 535M characters | June 2024 |
| Material Generator adoption | +100% | Roblox announcement |
| Model downloads | Growing | GitHub |
| Training dataset size | 1.5M assets | GDC 2025 |

---

## MSF Relevance

Roblox Cube 3D sets important precedents:

1. **Open-sourced foundation model** - Demonstrates that platform companies can release AI models openly

2. **Largest-scale UGC deployment** - Shows AI generation working at massive scale

3. **"4D" terminology** - Influences thinking about behavioral standards (3D + interaction)

4. **Runtime generation** - Demonstrates in-experience generation needs

**Engagement opportunity:** Cube's open-source nature makes it a potential reference implementation for MSF standards work.
