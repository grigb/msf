## Basic Information

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Organization** | Meta |
| **Type** | Commercial (Platform-embedded) |
| **Launch Date** | AI Suite April 2024 (production) |
| **Current Version** | Llama 4-powered (2025) |
| **URL** | [horizon.meta.com](https://horizon.meta.com) |
| **Availability** | Platform users |

<SRLBadge level={5} label="SRL-5: Early Adoption" />

## Capability Profile

| Capability | Support | Notes |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Text-to-Mesh | **Full** | 3-6 minutes, 4 options per generation |
| Skybox Generation | **Full** | Multiple style models |
| Code Generation | **Full** | TypeScript from natural language (Llama 4) |
| Sound/Audio Generation | **Full** | Text-to-audio production |
| AI NPCs | Coming | Announced for 2025 |
| Environment Generation | Coming | "Coming very soon" (Connect 2024) |


---

## Standards Compliance

| Standard | Compliance | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| **glTF 2.0** | Partial | Internal format primary |
| **OpenUSD** | Partial | Omniverse compatibility work |
| **Proprietary** | Full | Horizon-native formats |

---

## Maturity Assessment

**SRL Score:** SRL-5 (Early Adoption)

**Evidence:**
- Production deployment since April 2024
- Creators using GenAI tools increased world publishes by **31%**
- $50M Creator Fund supports adoption

---

## Interoperability

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Export Formats** | Limited; Horizon ecosystem primary |
| **Import Formats** | Text, images, reference media |
| **API Availability** | Internal platform only |
| **Known Integrations** | Horizon ecosystem, Meta Quest |

**Critical Gap:** Platform-locked; no export to other engines or platforms.

---

## Strengths

1. **Most comprehensive GenAI suite among Western platforms** - Covers mesh, skybox, code, audio, and soon NPCs

2. **Production-proven with measurable results** - 31% increase in world publishes demonstrates creator productivity gains

3. **Full-stack integration** - 3D, audio, code, NPCs all in single platform experience


---

## Limitations

1. **Platform-locked** - No export to other engines or platforms

2. **Environment generation not yet shipped** - Announced "coming soon" at Connect 2024

3. **Creator economics opaque** - Less transparent than Roblox's revenue sharing model

## Creator Impact

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| World publishes increase | +31% | Meta Connect 2024 |
| Creator Fund | $50M | Public announcement |
| Generation time (mesh) | 3-6 min | Platform documentation |
| Variations per prompt | 4 | Platform documentation |


---

## MSF Relevance

Meta Horizon Worlds demonstrates **platform-embedded AI generation at scale**. It is a key target for interoperability advocacy given:

- Meta's massive scale and user base
- Current lack of cross-platform export
- Full-stack approach (mesh, audio, code, NPCs)
- Measurable creator productivity gains

**Advocacy opportunity:** MSF could engage Meta on interoperability standards that would allow Horizon creators to export content to other platforms.
