## Maturity Assessment

**SRL Score:** SRL-3 (Prototype)

**Evidence:**
- Research publication demonstrating full pipeline
- Text to game-ready world with navmesh
- Not commercially available
- Likely path to Horizon Worlds integration

---

## Interoperability

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Export Formats** | Trimesh (GLB implied) |
| **Import Formats** | Text descriptions |
| **API Availability** | No (research only) |
| **Known Integrations** | None public; likely Horizon Worlds future |

---

## Strengths

1. **Only system with automatic navmesh generation** - Unique capability for game-ready output

2. **4-stage pipeline produces game-ready output** - Planning, reconstruction, decomposition, refinement

3. **Competitive generation latency** - ~5 minutes for 50x50m world


---

## Limitations

1. **Research only** - Not commercially available

2. **Hardware requirements unspecified** - Estimated 8x H100 equivalent

3. **Navmesh quality not benchmarked** - Not compared against manual creation

---

## 4-Stage Pipeline


### Stage 1: Scene Planning
- Text description parsed
- Room layout determined
- Object placement planned

### Stage 2: 3D Reconstruction
- Geometry generated from plan
- Multi-view synthesis
- Initial mesh creation

### Stage 3: Decomposition
- Scene segmented into objects
- Collision geometry extracted
- **Navmesh generated**

### Stage 4: Refinement
- Texture detail added
- Material properties assigned
- Final optimization

## Navmesh Generation

**WorldGen is unique** in generating navigation meshes as part of the world creation pipeline.


| System | Navmesh | Collision | Notes |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| **WorldGen** | **Auto** | **Auto** | Unique |
| Marble | None | Partial | Dual-mesh |
| Meshy | None | None | Asset only |
| Genie 3 | None | None | Video only |

## Research Implications

WorldGen demonstrates technical feasibility of:

1. **Integrated physics infrastructure** - Navmesh and collision in generation pipeline
2. **Text-to-game-ready workflow** - Minimal post-processing required
3. **Large-scale generation** - 50x50m worlds practical


---

## Expected Trajectory

| Timeline | Expected Development |
|----------|---------------------|
| 2025-2026 | Continued research publication |
| 2026-2027 | Potential Horizon Worlds integration |
| 2027+ | Possible commercial availability |

---

## MSF Relevance

WorldGen demonstrates that **geometry-native world generation with physics infrastructure is technically feasible**.

**Key monitoring priorities:**
- Production deployment timeline
- Navmesh quality benchmarks
- Integration with Horizon Worlds
- Potential open-source release

**Standards implications:**
- Navmesh can be part of generation, not just post-processing
- Quality validation profiles should include physics infrastructure
- AI metadata should include physics generation parameters
