## Appendix C: Methodology Notes

### Research Collection

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Models used | Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 1.5 Pro (historical research) |
| Queries executed | 50+ deep research queries across 6 months |
| Date range | December 2024 - January 2026 |
| Primary sources | GitHub repositories, SDO specifications, company documentation, academic papers |

### Maturity Assessment

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Assessment date | January 2026 |
| Assessor | AI x Metaverse Working Group |
| Validation | Cross-referenced against multiple research agents; verified against primary sources |
| Implementation counts | Validated against public metrics |

### SRL Score Assignment

SRL scores were assigned using the following process:

1. **Evidence Collection** - Gather data on funding, user counts, deployment status
2. **Level Mapping** - Map evidence to SRL scale criteria
3. **Cross-Validation** - Compare against peer implementations
4. **Consensus Review** - Working Group review and adjustment

### Limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|--------|------------|
| Vendor documentation may be aspirational | Some capabilities may be overstated | Cross-reference with user reports |
| SRL scores are estimates | Some subjectivity involved | Document evidence for each score |
| Rapidly evolving field | Findings may become outdated | Plan 6-month refresh cycle |
| Limited SDO access | May miss unpublished discussions | Engage through MSF liaison channels |
