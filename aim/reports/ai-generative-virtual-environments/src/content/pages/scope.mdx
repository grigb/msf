## Definition

AI-Generated Virtual Environments refers to AI systems that generate complete, interactive virtual environments for consumption by humans, AI agents, and machines. This encompasses two distinct technical paradigms:

1. **World Models** that understand dynamics and physics and generate interactive simulations
2. **3D Asset/Environment Generators** that produce exportable geometry, textures, and scene data compatible with game engines

The domain is characterized by:
- Rapid technological evolution (2024-2025 saw the emergence of "Large World Models" as a distinct category)
- Significant architectural diversity (video-based vs. geometry-based approaches)
- Fundamental questions about what "generation" means when outputs range from real-time video streams to batch-produced mesh files

### World Model Disambiguation

The term "world model" itself has two related but distinct meanings:

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Generative World Models** | Create external environments | World Labs Marble, Google Genie, NVIDIA Cosmos |
| **Internal Predictive World Models** | Reasoning systems for AI agents | Meta V-JEPA |

This report focuses on **Generative World Models**.

## In Scope

The following are explicitly within the scope of this research:

- AI systems that generate complete environments, levels, or worlds (batch and runtime)
- Outputs intended for interactive consumption in engines and runtimes (Unreal, Unity, web viewers)
- Geometry-native outputs (meshes, textures) and neural-native outputs (Gaussian splats)
- Multi-user contexts where players and agents consume the same world state
- Hybrid workflows combining procedural graphs with neural generation
- Generation metadata, reproducibility, and validation profiles
- Multiplayer determinism requirements for AI-generated content

## Out of Scope

| Topic | Reason | Covered By |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Agent cognition and decision-making | Distinct domain with different standards needs | MSF Autonomous Agents Use Case |
| Provenance and attribution standards | Infrastructure dependency | MSF Transparency and Provenance |
| Cross-platform asset format standards | General interchange, not AI-specific | 3D Asset Interoperability WG |
| NeRF representations | No portable format, not real-time viable | Academic research |
| AR-specific concerns (spatial anchoring) | Distinct requirements | MSF AR Use Cases 18-21 |
| Robotics-only training scenarios | Not intended for metaverse consumption | Industrial simulation standards |
