## Existing Standards

These standards are finalized and have established adoption in the industry.

| Standard | Organization | Status | Scope | Adoption |
|----------|--------------|--------|-------|----------|
| **glTF 2.0** | Khronos Group | Final | 3D asset interchange | High |
| **OpenUSD** | AOUSD | Final (24.11) | Scene description, industrial | Medium |
| **OpenXR** | Khronos Group | Final | XR device API | High |
| **WebXR Device API** | W3C | Final | Web-based XR | Medium |
| **VRM** | VRM Consortium | Final | Anime-style avatars | Medium (Japan) |
| **ONNX** | LF AI | Final | ML model interchange | High |

### glTF 2.0

The **primary interchange format** for 3D assets with broad engine support.

- **Scope:** Geometry, materials, textures, animations
- **AI Relevance:** Most AI tools export to glTF
- **Gap:** No AI generation metadata extension exists

### OpenUSD

The **emerging scene description standard** for complex scenes.

- **Scope:** Scene composition, hierarchies, variants
- **AI Relevance:** NVIDIA Cosmos native format
- **Gap:** No AI generation schemas defined

## Standards in Development

These standards are actively being developed and not yet finalized.

| Standard | Organization | Expected Date | Scope | Relevance |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-------|-----------|
| **KHR_gaussian_splatting** | Khronos Group | Unknown (no timeline) | 3D Gaussian splat in glTF | Critical for neural representations |
| **KHR_gaussian_splatting_compression_spz_2** | Khronos + Niantic | Unknown | SPZ compression for splats | Enables practical file sizes |
| **KHR_interactivity** | Khronos Group | Draft | Behavior graphs in glTF | Partial affordance solution |
| **OpenUSD Core Spec 1.0** | AOUSD | 2025-2026 | Foundational stability | Enterprise adoption driver |
| **OpenUSD Physics Extension** | AOUSD | Exploring | Physics representation | Game engine alignment |


### KHR_gaussian_splatting

**Critical for this domain** - enables neural representation interchange.

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Proposal | PR #2490 on GitHub |
| Timeline | No ratification date |
| Compression | SPZ_2 being developed |
| Engine Support | Pending standard |

### KHR_interactivity

Provides **behavior graphs in glTF** - partial solution for affordances.

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Status | Draft |
| Scope | Visual behavior graphs |
| Gap | No semantic vocabulary for affordances |

## De Facto Standards (Not Formalized)

These practices are widely used but not formally standardized.

| Practice | Origin | Adoption | Formalization Candidate? |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------------------|
| PLY for Gaussian splats | Academic convention | High (neural tools) | No - KHR_gaussian_splatting supersedes |
| JSON generation parameters | Common practice | Medium | Yes - MSF could propose schema |
| Seed-based reproducibility | Industry practice | High | Yes - MSF determinism work |
| FBX for rigged assets | Autodesk proprietary | High | No - proprietary format |
| SPZ compression | Niantic open source | Growing | Yes - being standardized via KHR |

### JSON Generation Parameters

Many tools export generation parameters as JSON, but with **no common schema**:

```json
// World Labs Marble (example)
{
  "prompt": "medieval castle courtyard",
  "seed": 42,
  "model_version": "2.1",
  "generation_time_ms": 45000
}

// Meshy (different schema)
{
  "input_text": "medieval castle courtyard",
  "random_seed": 42,
  "meshy_version": "5.0"
}
```

**Opportunity:** MSF could propose a unified schema for AI generation metadata.

### Critical Gaps (0% Coverage)

1. **AI Generation Metadata** - No standard schema for prompts, seeds, model versions
2. **3D Provenance** - C2PA covers images/video but not 3D formats
3. **Determinism** - No specification for reproducible generation across systems
4. **World Package** - No portable format for complete AI-generated worlds

### Partial Coverage (20-60%)

1. **Neural Representations** - KHR_gaussian_splatting in draft
2. **Affordances** - KHR_interactivity provides partial solution
3. **Navigation Mesh** - Recast is de facto but not standardized
4. **Physics** - Engine implementations only, no interchange standard

### Full Coverage (100%)

1. **3D Geometry** - glTF, USD, FBX well-established
2. **Textures/Materials** - PBR workflow standardized
