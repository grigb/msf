## Standards Readiness Level (SRL) Scale

The SRL scale provides a common framework for assessing the maturity of technologies relative to standardization.

<SRLScale />

| Level | Label | Description | Evidence Required |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| SRL-1 | Concept | Problem identified, no solutions | Published problem statement |
| SRL-2 | Research | Academic/research solutions exist | Peer-reviewed papers |
| SRL-3 | Prototype | Working prototypes demonstrated | Demo or proof-of-concept |
| SRL-4 | Pilot | Limited real-world deployment | Case studies, pilot reports |
| SRL-5 | Early Adoption | Multiple independent implementations | Market reports, user counts |
| SRL-6 | Growth | Significant market presence | Revenue/usage data |
| SRL-7 | Mainstream | Widely adopted, de facto standard | Industry surveys |
| SRL-8 | Mature | Formal standards exist and adopted | SDO publications |
| SRL-9 | Universal | Ubiquitous, assumed infrastructure | No alternatives considered |

## Domain Maturity Scorecard

Current assessment of AI-generated virtual environments across key dimensions.

| Dimension | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Technology Maturity** | <SRLBadge level={5} /> | Multiple production systems (Marble, Meshy, Roblox Cube); $230M+ funding for World Labs alone |
| **Standards Coverage** | <SRLBadge level={3} /> | glTF/USD cover geometry; neural formats (3DGS) draft only; AI metadata nonexistent |
| **Interoperability** | <SRLBadge level={3} /> | Tools export to glTF but with quality issues; neural-to-mesh lossy; platform lock-in common |
| **Market Adoption** | <SRLBadge level={5} /> | 3M+ Meshy users; Roblox AI tools in production; Meta Horizon AI deployed |
| **Overall** | <SRLBadge level={4} /> | Technology ahead of standards; interoperability is the bottleneck |


### Key Insight

**Technology is advancing faster than standards can track.**

The gap between Technology Maturity (SRL-5) and Standards Coverage (SRL-3) represents the primary opportunity for MSF intervention.

## Dimension Details

### Technology Maturity (SRL-5)

Multiple production-ready systems demonstrate the technology is viable:

| System | Evidence of Maturity |
|--------|---------------------|
| World Labs Marble | $230M+ funding, production SaaS |
| Meshy | 3M+ users, 30M+ assets |
| Roblox Cube | Open-sourced 1.8B model, production deployment |
| Meta Horizon AI | Production since April 2024, +31% world publishes |
| NVIDIA Cosmos | 300K+ users, 252 companies |

### Standards Coverage (SRL-3)

Formal standards lag behind technology:

| Area | Status | Gap |
|------|--------|-----|
| 3D Geometry | Full coverage (glTF, USD) | None |
| Neural Formats | Draft (KHR_gaussian_splatting) | No ratification timeline |
| AI Metadata | None | Critical gap |
| Provenance | None (C2PA lacks 3D) | Critical gap |

### Interoperability (SRL-3)

Cross-system content movement is fragmented:

| Challenge | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Platform lock-in | Roblox, Horizon, Fortnite all closed |
| Neural-to-mesh conversion | Lossy (~15% quality loss) |
| Generation metadata | No standard schema |
| Topology quality | Variable, often physics-incompatible |

### Market Adoption (SRL-5)

Significant commercial deployment exists:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Meshy users | 3M+ |
| Meshy assets generated | 30M+ |
| Blockade Labs users | 1.5M+ |
| Roblox AI code adoption | 535M characters |
| Horizon AI impact | +31% world publishes |

## Maturity Trajectory

Projected development over 1 and 3 year horizons.

<TrajectoryChart
  data={[
    { dimension: "Technology", current: 5, year1: 6, year3: 7, confidence: "HIGH" },
    { dimension: "Standards", current: 3, year1: 4, year3: 6, confidence: "MEDIUM" },
    { dimension: "Interoperability", current: 3, year1: 4, year3: 5, confidence: "MEDIUM" },
    { dimension: "Market Adoption", current: 5, year1: 6, year3: 7, confidence: "HIGH" }
  ]}
/>


| Dimension | Current | 1-Year | 3-Year | Confidence |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|------------|
| Technology | SRL-5 | SRL-6 | SRL-7 | HIGH |
| Standards | SRL-3 | SRL-4 | SRL-6 | MEDIUM |
| Interoperability | SRL-3 | SRL-4 | SRL-5 | MEDIUM |
| Market Adoption | SRL-5 | SRL-6 | SRL-7 | HIGH |

### Trajectory Notes

1. **Technology** is advancing faster than standards can track - HIGH confidence in continued growth

2. **Standards** projection assumes MSF and Khronos active engagement; without intervention, may stall at SRL-4

3. **Interoperability** improvement depends on platform cooperation - inherently uncertain

4. **Market Adoption** follows technology - consumers adopt tools regardless of standards

---

## Implications

### Without Intervention

If no standards work is undertaken:

- Technology continues to SRL-7 (mainstream)
- Standards stall at SRL-3-4 (fragmented)
- Interoperability remains at SRL-3 (platform silos)
- Market develops around proprietary ecosystems

### With MSF Action

If recommended standards work proceeds:

- Standards reach SRL-6 within 3 years
- Interoperability improves to SRL-5
- Cross-platform content movement becomes feasible
- Industry consolidates around shared standards

## Assessment Confidence

| Aspect | Confidence | Rationale |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Current SRL scores | HIGH | Based on multiple data sources |
| 1-year projections | MEDIUM-HIGH | Near-term trends observable |
| 3-year projections | MEDIUM | Depends on standards activities |
| Platform cooperation | LOW | Business decisions unpredictable |

## Assessment Methodology

This maturity assessment was conducted using:

1. **Implementation Analysis** - Direct examination of 35+ tools and platforms
2. **Standards Review** - SDO documentation and draft specifications
3. **Market Data** - User counts, funding, adoption metrics
4. **Expert Input** - AI x Metaverse Working Group consensus

**Assessment Date:** January 2026
**Next Review:** Q3 2026
