## Domain Definition

AI-Generated Virtual Environments encompasses AI systems that generate complete, interactive 3D environments for games, metaverse platforms, and simulation, spanning both **video-based world models** (which output interactive video streams) and **geometry-based generators** (which output exportable 3D assets).

<SRLBadge level={4} label="Overall Maturity: Pilot" />

## Key Findings

<div className="key-findings-grid">

<KeyFindingCard number={1} title="Two Paradigms Coexist with Incompatible Outputs">
The domain is fundamentally split between video-based world models (Genie 3, Oasis) that generate real-time interactive streams but cannot export 3D geometry, and geometry-based systems (Marble, WorldGen, Meshy) that produce game-engine-compatible assets but require minutes to hours of generation time. **No bridge exists between these paradigms**, creating a significant standards opportunity.
</KeyFindingCard>

<KeyFindingCard number={2} title="Standards Infrastructure is Critically Underdeveloped">
Key standards are far less mature than commonly assumed. C2PA has no 3D format support, no AI-specific glTF extensions exist, OpenUSD has no AI generation schemas, and KHR_gaussian_splatting remains an experimental draft with no ratification timeline.
</KeyFindingCard>

<KeyFindingCard number={3} title="Production Quality Requires Human Intervention">
Despite marketing claims, all current systems require **10-30 hours of manual cleanup per scene** for production use. Generated meshes suffer from non-manifold geometry, topology errors, and physics incompatibility that breaks standard collision detection.
</KeyFindingCard>

<KeyFindingCard number={4} title="Robotics is Driving Innovation More Than Gaming">
NVIDIA Cosmos and similar "Physical AI" systems designed for robotics training are advancing faster than consumer-focused tools. The MSF definition of metaverse (including machines as consumers) positions this as within scope.
</KeyFindingCard>

<KeyFindingCard number={5} title="Interoperability is the Primary Blocker">
Each major system (Marble, Genie 3, Cosmos, WorldGen) uses proprietary formats and APIs. Even among geometry-based systems, output formats (Gaussian splats vs. trimesh) are incompatible, and engine support (Unity/Unreal) relies on third-party plugins.
</KeyFindingCard>

## Standards Readiness Assessment

| Dimension | Score | Summary |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Overall Maturity** | SRL-4 | Pilot stage |
| **Standardization Priority** | HIGH | Urgent action needed |
| **Primary Gap** | Critical | No cross-platform schema for AI generation metadata, reproducibility parameters, or portable world packaging |

## Recommended MSF Actions

<ActionItem priority={1} effort="MEDIUM" timeline="Q2 2026">
**Propose a glTF extension for AI generation metadata** (MSF_ai_generation_metadata) covering prompts, seeds, model versions, and quality metrics.
</ActionItem>

<ActionItem priority={2} effort="LOW" timeline="Q1 2026">
**Advocate to C2PA Coalition for 3D workflow support**, including glTF and USD embedding mechanisms for provenance tracking.
</ActionItem>

<ActionItem priority={3} effort="HIGH" timeline="Q4 2026">
**Convene an interoperability working session** bringing together World Labs, NVIDIA, Meta, and Khronos to address neural-to-mesh conversion standards.
</ActionItem>
