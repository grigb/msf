## Request

Add a dedicated "Reference Corpus" subsection in appendices that exposes deep-research sources and synthesis lineage in browsable form.

## Context

- Appendices source: `/Users/grig/work/MSF - Metaverse Standards Forum/repo/msf/aim/reports/ai-generative-virtual-environments/src/content/pages/appendices.mdx`
- Existing Appendix B is currently manual and summary-level.

## Scope

1. Integrate generated source manifests into appendices.
2. Show lineage from synthesis outputs to source records.
3. Preserve current appendix readability while adding depth.

## Tasks

1. Add new "Reference Corpus" subsection (or split page under appendices route).
2. Render source inventory from `sources.json`.
3. Render lineage mapping from `lineage.json`.
4. Add quick filters/groupings by source type and category.

## Success Criteria

- Readers can browse actual corpus records from the site.
- Synthesis-to-source lineage is visible and linked.
- Appendix content remains navigable and performant.
